Demo of Node support for new Ext JS 4 Class Loader

Most of this code is 100% unmodified taken from http://www.sencha.com/blog/2011/01/19/countdown-to-ext-js-4-dynamic-loading-and-new-class-system/

Two new files were added:
ext-nodebootstrap.js -- Bootstrap file to use for Node support
nodedemo.js -- Startup file similar to index.html which contains actual application logic

To see example, run:
node ext-nodebootstrap.js nodedemo.js
